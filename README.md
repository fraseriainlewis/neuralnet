# neuralnet
Examples of installing [mlpack](http://www.mlpack.org) from source and using via C++ to build and fit neural networks. 

The installation example uses a Linux docker image [Ubuntu 18.04](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) and [mlpack version 3.1.1](https://www.mlpack.org/files/mlpack-3.1.1.tar.gz). It is assumed docker is installed on the host OS (in this case macOS Mojave 10.14.5 and Docker Desktop Community edition 2.0.0.3, but this should work on any host system with a docker installation. It has also been tested on CentOS).
