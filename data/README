note that create_data.R in above directory has rcode to create dummy data sets but this does not
create features0.csv and labelsBNL10.csv which are used with ffn_ex2* and ffn_ex3* as these were
created with same code but on different machine with different rv stream. So do not delete these
files are there results correspond to the readme.md output
